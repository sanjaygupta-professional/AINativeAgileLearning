**Author:** Gail Goodrich Harwood

## Introduction: Designing for Collaboration

While traditional organizations by design often promote noncollaborative behavior, this circumstance can be overcome. **Purposeful design, led by enlightened leaders, can reshape behavior and unleash a collaborative win-win spirit.**

As Rosabeth Moss Kanter wrote in *Frontiers of Management*:

> "Boundaries are sometimes a mental imposition—a decision to divide the world a certain way. They become real when social patterns come to enforce the imaginary walls and when once deliberate choices become mindless habits.... But history teaches us not to assume their permanence.... What matters most today is the ability to think together, not alone. To think imaginatively about matters of substance, incorporating many perspectives and reaching beyond conventional categories. To create new concepts that make new connections..."

### Chapter Organization

This chapter breaks down the **design process for virtual collaboration into ten principles**, defining:
- Why each principle is important
- How to design for success
- Practical advice for implementation

A **summary design checklist** concludes the chapter.

- Alliances cross traditional lines

**Today's leaders must embrace, teach, coach, and encourage collaboration as the norm.**

### The Critical Competency

Communication is the critical competency for leaders of virtual collaboration work:

> "The capacity to create a compelling vision that takes people to a new place, and to translate that vision into action." 
> — Bennis & Goldsmith, 1997
