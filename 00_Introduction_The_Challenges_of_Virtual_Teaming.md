## Overview

For over a decade, practitioners and academics alike have struggled with the realities of virtual teaming. The challenges of working virtually have been well-documented, yet many still convey feelings of discomfort or dissatisfaction with the belief that "this would have taken us half the time and turned out better if we had been together in the same room, face-to-face."

From extensive research and practice, **six major challenges** of virtual teams have been identified:

1. **Distance**
2. **Time**
3. **Technology**
4. **Culture**
5. **Trust**
6. **Leadership**

### The Two Categories of Challenges

These six challenges can be understood in two distinct categories:

#### Virtual Team Givens (First Three Challenges)
- **Distance, Time, and Technology** are defining characteristics or givens of virtual teams
- They represent discrete (measurable), bounded conditions
- They are dissolved or managed through technology
- They are necessary but not sufficient for high performance

#### Virtual Team Creations (Last Three Challenges)
- **Culture, Trust, and Leadership** are created and sustained by the virtual team itself
- Culture or cultural differences may impede or propel forward virtual team success
- They occur at many levels concurrently (nationally, at corporate headquarters, within dispersed units)
- Trust and leadership are present or absent in varying degrees and forms
- They can be considered dynamic, organizational, cultural realities

## Issues Surrounding the Six Challenges

### 1. Distance

Distance represents a challenge for virtual teams because it imposes limits on the face-to-face interaction that is important in:
- Building trust
- Monitoring performance
- Inspiring teamwork
- Maintaining cultural norms
- Understanding cultural differences

#### The Challenge of Member Identification

Virtual teams do not share physical workspace as traditional colocated teams do, creating both obvious and subtle challenges. Over most of the past century, large corporations created mass production systems that required the congregation of employees at central places of work. 

**Member identification** refers to the strength of an individual's cognitive attachment to the organization, constructed and supported by cues that pull employees together:
- Shared language
- Dress code
- Organizational norms
- Organizational identifiers (office building, coworkers, company logos)

#### Link to Trust and Commitment

Member identification has been linked to employees' feelings of trust characterized by:
- Internalization of organizational norms and practices
- Desire to remain with the organization
- Willingness to cooperate with others
- Willingness to share knowledge

#### The Weakening Bond

Information technology and virtual teams enable a decentralization of work, making it possible for employees to work together while being spatially and temporally separated. However, this freedom to work any time and anywhere may also weaken the bond between organizational members and their employer, possibly resulting in:
- Reduction in employee commitment to the organization
- Lower job satisfaction
- Feelings of isolation
- Loss of productivity
- Loneliness and vulnerability from feeling "out of the loop"

#### Building Connection Despite Distance

Nevertheless, some virtual teams have achieved high levels of interpersonal bonding. This personal connection among team members has been described as a family-like feeling that goes beyond common goals and commitment to the work. 

**Techniques for strengthening connection:**
- Face-to-face get-togethers
- Electronically sharing humorous stories or incidents
- Creating playful games to build and maintain team identity
- Taking time to show personal interest in one another
- Sharing personal issues and crises with team members
- Functioning as a support network for one another

#### Additional Distance Challenges

Virtual team members are also susceptible to:
- Greater difficulty building rapport, trust, group norms, and work protocols
- More challenging communication processes
- Need for greater diligence and discipline about keeping in touch
- Need for more deliberate information sharing (it doesn't happen automatically as in shared physical space)

### 2. Time

Virtual teams are simultaneously more and less bound than traditional face-to-face teams by the restrictions of time. Time differences create both advantages and disadvantages.

#### Challenges of Time Differences

**Coordination difficulties:**
- Extremely challenging to schedule meetings
- Difficult to coordinate globally dispersed teams
- Questions requiring guidance may have to wait several hours
- Decisions may take longer to be made
- Struggle to maintain work/life balance

**Example scenario:** Consider a team with members from the United Kingdom and the Pacific Northwest in the United States (8-hour time difference). Just as U.S. team members arrive at work, U.K. team members are wrapping up their workday. For real-time collaboration, one group must work outside normal hours.

#### The "Call Anytime" Policy

A common solution is adopting a "call anytime" policy:
- Attempts are made not to contact members outside working hours
- If an answer is vital to the project, contact at any time is allowed
- Creates a 24-hour workday in a different (and potentially problematic) sense
- Can gradually erode quality of both work and nonwork experience
- Attitudes differ among cultures and individuals regarding work outside normal office hours
- Can create tension among team members

#### Advantages of Time Differences

**The 24-hour workday advantage:**
- Teams can hand off work at the end of their day to members around the globe who are just beginning
- Near around-the-clock progress is possible
- Work can literally be handed off around the clock among three main economic centers:
  - United States
  - Europe
  - Asia
- Can significantly shorten project time

### 3. Technology

The vast majority of virtual team communication is carried out with the assistance of technology, creating its own set of challenges.

#### Learning and Skill Development Challenges

**Initial barriers:**
- Employees must learn the technology before using it for collaboration
- Getting members comfortable with technology-mediated interaction can be difficult
- Need to reach required skill levels in using communication technology

**Two dimensions of technology competency:**
1. **Knowing how to operate** the technology
2. **Knowing when it is appropriate to use** different types of technology for different purposes (matching technology and task)

#### Interorganizational Challenges

Virtual teams made up of members from different organizations often face:
- Incompatible technology platforms
- Incompatible communication tools
- Trust and security issues
- Need to act outside traditional comfort zones
- Need to trust information to individuals who in other situations would be competitors

#### Technology as an Enabler

Some researchers suggest that collaborative technology enables both:
- Virtual team functioning
- Organizational learning

However, they note that **technology is less important than the techniques** virtual teams have developed to interact:
- Communication and group norms
- Appropriate virtual team leadership styles and structures
- Regularly scheduled meetings
- Occasional face-to-face meetings

### 4. Culture

The way a team functions is often directly related to the culture of the organization, but challenges can also arise from national cultural differences.

#### Organizational Culture Impact

- Teams inherit organizational culture norms
- Virtual teams may experience fragmented organizational culture
- Different sites may have developed their own subcultures
- Competing values and practices across locations create friction

#### National Cultural Dimensions

Cultural differences can significantly impact virtual team dynamics across multiple dimensions:
- Communication styles (direct vs. indirect)
- Decision-making approaches (individual vs. consensus)
- Time orientation (monochronic vs. polychronic)
- Power distance (hierarchical vs. egalitarian)
- Uncertainty avoidance
- Individualism vs. collectivism

#### Cultural Intelligence Required

Virtual team members must develop:
- Awareness of their own cultural assumptions
- Understanding of others' cultural perspectives
- Ability to bridge cultural differences
- Flexibility in adapting behaviors
- Respect for diverse approaches

### 5. Trust

Trust is fundamental to virtual team success but is more difficult to establish and maintain without face-to-face interaction.

#### Why Trust Matters More in Virtual Teams

- Greater uncertainty in virtual settings
- Reduced social cues and context
- More opportunity for misunderstanding
- Higher stakes for collaboration failures
- Dependency on teammates you may never meet

#### Types of Trust in Virtual Teams

**Swift trust:**
- Imported from other contexts
- Based on roles and reputations
- Necessary for quick team formation
- Fragile and needs reinforcement

**Knowledge-based trust:**
- Develops over time through interaction
- Based on predictability and reliability
- Strengthened through consistent behavior
- More stable than swift trust

**Identification-based trust:**
- Highest level of trust
- Based on shared values and goals
- Mutual understanding of needs and preferences
- Rare but powerful in virtual teams

#### Building Trust Virtually

Key practices for developing trust:
- Consistent and timely communication
- Following through on commitments
- Transparency in decision-making
- Responsiveness to team members
- Acknowledging mistakes and problems
- Sharing credit and success

### 6. Leadership

Leadership in virtual teams requires different approaches than traditional face-to-face team leadership.

#### Unique Leadership Challenges

Virtual team leaders must:
- Manage without visual oversight
- Coordinate across time zones
- Navigate cultural differences
- Use technology effectively
- Build team cohesion remotely
- Monitor performance indirectly
- Provide support at a distance

#### Essential Leadership Competencies

**Communication skills:**
- Clear and frequent communication
- Multiple communication channels
- Explicit expectations and guidelines
- Active listening across mediums

**Relationship building:**
- Creating psychological safety
- Fostering team identity
- Recognizing individual contributions
- Building connections among members

**Task management:**
- Setting clear goals and milestones
- Coordinating distributed work
- Managing dependencies
- Ensuring accountability

**Cultural sensitivity:**
- Understanding diverse perspectives
- Adapting leadership style
- Mediating cultural conflicts
- Leveraging diversity as strength
