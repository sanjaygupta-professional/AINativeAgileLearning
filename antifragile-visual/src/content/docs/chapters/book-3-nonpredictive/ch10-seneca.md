# Chapter 10: Seneca's Upside and Downside

> "Seneca was the wealthiest person in the Roman Empire... yet he practiced poverty."

## The Core Insight

The Stoic philosopher **Seneca** was extraordinarily wealthy, yet he regularly practiced living with nothing. This wasn't contradiction—it was **asymmetric wisdom**: enjoy the upside of wealth while being mentally prepared for its loss. This removes fragility.
