# Chapter 9: Fat Tony and the Fragilistas

> "Fat Tony has an attribute: he doesn't believe in explanations."

## The Core Insight

Taleb introduces **Fat Tony**, a Brooklyn character who represents practical wisdom—the ability to thrive through street smarts rather than academic knowledge. His opposite is the **Fragilista**: someone who applies fragile theoretical frameworks to complex situations.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Practical wisdom matters** — Street smarts often beat book smarts
2. **Models aren't reality** — The map is not the territory
3. **Skin in the game filters** — Trust those with something to lose
4. **Context matters** — Abstract answers can be practically wrong

## Think About It

- Are you more like Fat Tony or Dr. John?
- Whose advice do you follow—those with or without skin in the game?
- What practical wisdom have you learned that can't be taught in books?
