# Chapter 14: When Two Things Are Not the Same Thing

> "The green lumber fallacy: confusing knowledge about a product's price behavior with knowledge about the product itself."

## The Core Insight

A successful lumber trader thought "green lumber" meant painted green, when it actually means freshly cut. His ignorance of this "basic" fact didn't matter—he understood price behavior. This is the **green lumber fallacy**: confusing different types of knowledge, and assuming academic knowledge translates to practical success.

## Visual: The Green Lumber Fallacy

```mermaid

    subgraph Fallacy["THE GREEN LUMBER FALLACY"]
        Trader["Successful Lumber Trader"]

        Trader --> Know["KNEW:<br/>Price movements,<br/>market behavior,<br/>how to trade"]
        Trader --> NotKnow["DIDN'T KNOW:<br/>'Green lumber' means<br/>freshly cut, not painted"]

        Know --> Success["Made millions 💰"]
        NotKnow --> NoMatter["Didn't matter!"]
    end

## Two Types of Knowledge

            A1["Facts about things"]
            A2["Theoretical understanding"]

## The Inverse Knowledge Problem

        Success --> Q1["Does NOT require<br/>knowing 'why' it works"]
        Success --> Q2["Requires knowing<br/>'how' to do it"]
    end

    Q1 --> Example1["Grandmother's soup<br/>recipe works without<br/>chemistry degree"]
    Q2 --> Example2["Successful traders<br/>without finance PhD"]

## Key Takeaways

1. **Don't confuse knowledge types** — Knowing about ≠ knowing how
2. **Practical knowledge wins** — Results matter more than understanding
3. **Beware credentials** — Degrees don't guarantee practical skill
4. **Focus on what matters** — Learn what drives outcomes

## Think About It

- What "basic" knowledge might be irrelevant to your goals?
- Where do you confuse theoretical and practical knowledge?
- What heuristics work for you without fully understanding why?
