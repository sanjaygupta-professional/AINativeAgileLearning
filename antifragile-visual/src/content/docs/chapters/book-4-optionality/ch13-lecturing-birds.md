# Chapter 13: Lecturing Birds on How to Fly

> "We think that we invented mathematics, but mathematics was there before us."

## The Core Insight

There's a common **narrative** that academic theory drives practical innovation. In reality, it's often the reverse: practitioners tinker and discover, then academics come later to explain and formalize. It's like lecturing birds on aerodynamics after they've been flying for millions of years.

## Visual: The Narrative Reversal

## Examples of Practice Before Theory

## Key Takeaways

1. **Practice often precedes theory** — Don't wait for complete understanding
2. **Tinkering is powerful** — Trial and error discovers what theory can't
3. **Beware expert narratives** — They often reverse cause and effect
4. **Action over analysis** — Start doing, learn by doing

## Think About It

- Where are you waiting for theory before you act?
- What could you learn by tinkering that no book could teach?
- What "expert" narratives might have causation reversed?
