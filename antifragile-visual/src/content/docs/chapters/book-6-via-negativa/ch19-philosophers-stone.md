# Chapter 19: The Philosopher's Stone and Its Inverse

> "The philosopher's stone was the substance that could turn lead into gold. But if the key to life were via negativa, we don't need this stone."

## The Core Insight

The legendary philosopher's stone could turn lead into gold—via positiva (adding value). But the inverse is often more powerful: removing what's harmful (via negativa). You don't need to add gold; just remove the lead.

## Visual: Via Negativa vs Via Positiva

            P1["Add good things"]
            P2["Accumulate"]

## Key Takeaways

1. **Subtract first** — Remove harm before adding good
2. **Negative knowledge** — We know what's wrong more than what's right
3. **Less risky** — Removal is more predictable than addition
4. **Avoid charlatans** — They always want to add things

## Think About It

- What could you remove from your life right now?
- What additions have actually made things worse?
- Where do you add when you should subtract?
