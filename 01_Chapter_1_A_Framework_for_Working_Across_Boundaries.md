## Introduction: Understanding Boundaries

Boundaries exist everywhere in human experience and take many forms. By their very nature, collaboration always involves crossing boundaries. This requires first recognizing the various delimiters as borders, borderlands, walls, membership requirements, or limitations.

### The Nature of Boundaries

Boundaries can include:
- Physical spaces where conversations can or cannot occur
- Uniforms and other visible signs of authority
- Government and corporate regimes that prohibit free access
- Political divides (like the center aisle in Washington)
- Delimiters in one's own mind that prevent stretching and achieving more

These boundary conditions have enormous scope and significance, impacting human life sometimes without our awareness and often without our consent. Some are of our own making, and others are thrust on us as members of the societies we inhabit.

### The Risk and Reward of Boundary Crossing

In transgressing boundaries, one's behavior is sometimes labeled "out-of-bounds." In traditional organizational societies, including the family, this often results in sanctions of varying severity or duration:
- Docking of pay
- Grounding (as in teenagers)
- A disapproving look

However, **boundaries limit the flow of essential inputs and outputs** such as:
- People
- Information
- Materials
- Ideas
- Energy

### Boundary Crossers as Innovators

Individuals who exist on the boundary—at the margins of the organization or society—are usually those best suited in temperament and interest to:
- Comment on the status quo (often a high-risk activity)
- Take practical actions necessary to step into foreign territory
- Create something new

**For teams to leverage local resources, boundaries have to be opened up so flow is permitted, valued, and supported. It takes courageous individuals to do this.**

## Historic Boundary Crossings and Innovation

In recent decades, crossing boundaries has created remarkable innovations:

### Disciplinary Boundary Crossings
- **Biochemistry** - crossing biology and chemistry boundaries
- **Information genomics** - traversing information science and genetics
- Creation of entirely new sciences

### Organizational Boundary Crossings
- **Integrated solutions** - traversing boundaries between product and service groups
- Expanding customer bases worldwide
- Taking care of customers holistically

### Company Boundary Crossings
- **Knowledge transfer** - rich opportunities across organizational lines
- **Technology transfer** - sharing innovations
- **Joint ventures** - formal collaborations
- **Strategic alliances** - long-term partnerships

### What Makes Boundary Crossing Successful

Each successful boundary crossing has involved individuals who are fully committed to:
- Doing the hard work of communicating with one another
- Risking ventures into uncharted territory and all the ambiguity this entails
- Sharing tangible product and process knowledge and skills
- Engaging the human desire to be involved in creative work for the sake of new possibilities
- Turning these assets into successful shared outcomes
- Providing impetus for further innovation

## Boundary Conditions That Impede Virtual Teams

Members of virtual teams can benefit by identifying the boundaries that may limit their progress toward successful boundary crossings. The following boundary conditions may impede virtual team collaboration:

### Individual Boundaries

- **Gender** - Different gender perspectives and experiences
- **Age** - Generational differences in approaches
- **Discipline** - Different professional training and frameworks
- **Identity** - "Who are we?" questions
- **Ethnic background** - Different cultural perspectives
- **Personal** - Differing tastes or preferences
- **Native language** - Communication barriers
- **Preverbal** - Unable to articulate hunches or intuitions
- **Theoretical framework** - Different academic or professional paradigms
- **Ethical** - Varying moral frameworks
- **Historical** - Differing experience with virtual teams
- **Individual** - Assumptions, values, biases, goals, styles

### Technical Boundaries

- **Differing technological systems** - Incompatible computer systems
- **Technical language** - Jargon and specialized terminology

### Spatial/Geographic/Environmental Boundaries

- **Time** - Different time zones
- **Geography** - Distance, political environment
- **Country** - Restrictions in sharing technical knowledge (e.g., defense implications)
- **Economic** - Different economic contexts
- **Culture** - Differing country value systems

### Task-Related Boundaries

- **Task** - Different understanding of what is to be done
- **Skills** - Differing skill levels among team members
- **Project** - Assignment to multiple projects that compete for one's time
- **Resources** - Some members have plentiful support, others have scarce resources

### Organizational Boundaries

- **Culture** - Differing company value systems
- **Departmental** - Differing local politics
- **Company** - Restrictions in sharing proprietary knowledge
- **Control or authority** - "Who is leading what?"

## Using the Boundary Checklist

Although this list is exhaustive, it is not intended to be overwhelming. Rather, treat the items as a **checklist to identify the top three, four, or five boundaries** that your virtual team needs to explicitly address.

### Facilitation Questions

Questions to facilitate team member discussion include:

1. **Impact Assessment:** How is this boundary affecting the team's ability to work together to achieve its goals?

2. **Resource Needs:** Is something extra needed to make crossing each of these boundaries easier?

3. **Action Planning:** What can be done to reduce the barriers represented by this boundary condition?

## Understanding Boundary Permeability

### The Permeability Concept

**Permeability** is defined as the degree to which matter (using the biological paradigm at the cell level) can pass through the cell (or unit) walls. Permeability affects the ability of virtual teams and brick-and-mortar units to span boundary limits and form new configurations.

### The Permeability Continuum

Boundaries exist on a continuum of four conditions:

```
[Too Open] ←→ [Open] ←→ [Slightly Open] ←→ [Closed]
```

#### Too Open
- Minimal requirements for membership
- May allow too many to join
- Loss of focus or cohesion
- Dilution of expertise or purpose

#### Open
- Reasonable access while maintaining standards
- Facilitates collaboration and flow
- Balances inclusion with quality

#### Slightly Open
- Selective permeability
- Careful vetting of participants
- Maintains high standards

#### Closed
- Excessive requirements
- May prevent good candidates from joining
- Limits innovation and fresh perspectives
- Can create silos

### No Optimal Condition

**Important:** There is no single optimal condition for boundary permeability. Boundaries ideally **fluctuate in degree of openness** depending on:
- Particular task requirements
- Current team needs
- Stage of project development
- External environment demands

**Think of permeability as a condition that can be actively managed for success rather than a stable constraint.**

## Building Shared Culture Across Boundaries

### The Four-Member Team Example

Consider a four-member team that is embedded in separate:
- Discipline silos
- Department silos
- Country silos

This team begins to build a **shared culture** through:
- Learning about members' differing work contexts
- Understanding different perspectives
- Finding common ground
- Creating new norms together

### Visualizing Boundary Crossing

```
Team Member 1          Team Member 2
(Discipline A,         (Discipline B,
 Dept X, Country 1)     Dept Y, Country 2)
        ↓                     ↓
        └─────────┬───────────┘
                  ↓
        Emerging Shared Culture
                  ↓
        ┌─────────┴───────────┐
        ↓                     ↓
Team Member 3          Team Member 4
(Discipline C,         (Discipline D,
 Dept Z, Country 3)     Dept W, Country 4)
```

## Managing Boundaries: Complex Operations

Managing boundaries is an **inherently complex process** with a number of discrete operations:

### Boundary Management Operations

1. **Recognize** - Identify existing boundaries
2. **Maintain** - Keep necessary boundaries in place
3. **Close** - Tighten boundaries when needed
4. **Open** - Loosen boundaries to allow flow
5. **Cross** - Traverse boundaries effectively
6. **Reform** - Reshape existing boundaries
7. **Change** - Modify boundary characteristics
8. **Destroy** - Eliminate unnecessary boundaries
9. **Merge** - Combine boundaries into new forms

### Keys to Effective Boundary Management

The choice of operation and the effectiveness of action determine whether the boundary will be managed in a way that promotes:
- **Excellence** - High performance
- **Mediocrity** - Adequate but uninspiring performance

The most suppressive boundaries are those that are:
- Unrecognized
- Unquestioned
- Assumed to be permanent
- Enforced through mindless habits

## Creating a Collaborative Mindset

### Breaking Down Mental Impositions

As Rosabeth Moss Kanter wrote in *Frontiers of Management*:

> "Boundaries are sometimes a mental imposition—a decision to divide the world a certain way. They become real when social patterns come to enforce the imaginary walls and when once deliberate choices become mindless habits.... But history teaches us not to assume their permanence."

### What Matters Most

> "What matters most today is the ability to think together, not alone. To think imaginatively about matters of substance, incorporating many perspectives and reaching beyond conventional categories. To create new concepts that make new connections..."

### The Win-Win Mentality

Successful boundary crossing requires:
- A mentality that says, "We all win together"
- Recognition that boundaries are often artificial constructs
- Willingness to question assumptions
- Courage to venture beyond familiar territory
- Commitment to collaborative success
