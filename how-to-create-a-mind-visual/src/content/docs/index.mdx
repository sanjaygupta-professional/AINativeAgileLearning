## The Big Idea

Ray Kurzweil's central thesis is that the **neocortex**—the thin outer layer of the brain responsible for higher thought—uses a single, elegant algorithm repeated approximately **300 million times**. This Pattern Recognition Theory of Mind (PRTM) explains how we perceive, remember, think, and create.

Published in 2012, **How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed** by Ray Kurzweil presents a comprehensive theory of how the human brain works and how we can use that understanding to create intelligent machines.

Kurzweil, a renowned inventor and futurist, draws on decades of work in artificial intelligence—including pioneering speech recognition and language understanding systems—to propose that the brain's neocortex uses a fundamentally simple algorithm, repeated hundreds of millions of times, to achieve the remarkable complexity of human thought.
